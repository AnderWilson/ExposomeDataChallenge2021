#  Using causal random forest to determine exposure environmenents with high sexual dimorphisms

We took part in the Exposome Data Challenge to examine whether we could identify exposure environments with high sexual dimorphism in human development. For answering this questions we used our implementation of causal random forest ([teff](https://github.com/teff-package/teff)).
